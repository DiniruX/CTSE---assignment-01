# TRAVEL BUDDY - A ride sharing application for SLIIT students.


Travel Buddy is a ride-sharing application developed exclusively for SLIIT students who have transportation concerns. It was shown that the majority of SLIIT students had commuting problems when they have to attend lectures at night. This was mostly brought up by female students. Travel buddy was created as a solution to this problem. Through this app students traveling in vehicles can share the ride with another student(s) who travels to the same area. This report provides an overview of the app from the requirement collecting process to the final release.
The problem statement mentioned about 2 types of users for the travel buddy app.
1.	Ride seeker- One who wishes to get a lift by a shared car.
2.	Vehicle Owner- One who wishes to share his ride with other students.
The designed solution should serve both types of users.
